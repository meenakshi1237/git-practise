Git offers a wide range of features that are essential for developers to manage and collaborate on code efficiently. Here are the important Git concepts and commands that every developer should know:

1. Basic Commands
git init: Initialize a new Git repository.
git clone: Clone an existing repository.
git add: Stage changes for commit.
git commit: Save changes to the repository.
git status: Check the status of your repository.
git log: View commit history.
git diff: Compare changes between commits, branches, or your working directory.
2. Branching
What is it?
A branch allows you to work on a separate line of development without affecting the main branch (e.g., main or master).
Important Commands:
git branch: List branches or create a new branch.
git checkout -b branch-name: Create and switch to a new branch.
git switch branch-name: Switch between branches (alternative to checkout).
git merge branch-name: Merge changes from one branch into another.
git branch -d branch-name: Delete a branch.
3. Stashing
What is it?
Temporarily save your changes without committing them.
Important Commands:
git stash: Save changes in a stash.
git stash list: List all stashes.
git stash apply: Reapply the last stash.
git stash drop: Delete a stash after applying it.
4. Rebasing
What is it?
Rebase rewrites the commit history to make it linear.
Important Commands:
git rebase branch-name: Rebase your current branch onto another branch.
git rebase --continue: Continue rebase after resolving conflicts.
Use with caution as it rewrites history and can cause issues if shared commits are rebased.
5. Cherry-Picking
What is it?
Apply specific commits from one branch to another.
Important Command:
git cherry-pick commit-hash
6. Resetting and Reverting
What is it?
Undo changes in your repository.
Important Commands:
git reset: Move the HEAD pointer to a previous commit and optionally reset your working directory.
git revert: Create a new commit that undoes the changes in a specific commit.
7. Tagging
What is it?
Mark a specific commit as a release or checkpoint.
Important Commands:
git tag tag-name: Create a lightweight tag.
git tag -a tag-name -m "message": Create an annotated tag.
git push origin tag-name: Push a tag to the remote repository.
8. Pulling and Pushing
What is it?
Sync changes between your local and remote repository.
Important Commands:
git pull origin branch-name: Fetch and merge changes from the remote branch.
git push origin branch-name: Push your changes to the remote branch.
9. Conflict Resolution
What is it?
Resolve merge conflicts when changes overlap between branches.
Process:
Identify conflicts with git status.
Edit the conflicted files.
Stage the resolved files with git add.
Complete the merge with git commit or git rebase --continue.
10. Squashing Commits
What is it?
Combine multiple commits into a single commit for a cleaner history.
Important Commands:
git rebase -i HEAD~n: Squash the last n commits.
Mark commits as squash or s during the interactive rebase.
11. Forking and Collaboration
What is it?
Forking creates a copy of a repository under your account for making changes and contributing.
Process:
Fork the repository.
Clone your fork.
Create a branch, make changes, and push.
Raise a Merge Request (MR) or Pull Request (PR) to the original repository.
12. Blame
What is it?
See who made changes to a specific file or line.
Important Command:
git blame file-name
13. Hooks
What is it?
Scripts that automate actions during Git events (e.g., pre-commit, post-merge).
Example: Linting code before committing changes.
14. Git Configurations
What is it?
Set up global or repository-specific settings.
Important Commands:
git config --global user.name "Your Name": Set your name.
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com": Set your email.
git config --list: View all configurations.
15. Cleaning Up
What is it?
Remove untracked files or directories.
Important Commands:
git clean -f: Remove untracked files.
git clean -fd: Remove untracked files and directories.
16. Submodules
What is it?
Manage external repositories as part of your project.
Important Commands:
git submodule add url path: Add a submodule.
git submodule update: Update submodules.
17. Best Practices
Always pull the latest changes before starting new work.
Use branches for new features or bug fixes.
Write meaningful commit messages.
Keep commits small and focused.
Rebase feature branches to keep history clean before merging.
Summary Table

What is Git Stashing?
Git stashing allows you to temporarily save changes in your working directory that are not ready to be committed, without having to create a commit or lose the changes when switching branches or pulling updates.

Why is Stashing Required?
Switching Branches:
When you need to switch to another branch but have uncommitted changes that you don’t want to include in a commit yet.
Clean Working Directory:
When you need to pull updates from a remote repository or apply patches, but your working directory has changes that might conflict.
Experimental Work:
When you’re experimenting with code changes but don’t want to commit them to the repository yet.
Interruptions:
When you need to pause your current work to address another task without committing unfinished work.
How Does Stashing Differ From Committing?
Feature	Stashing	Committing
Purpose	Temporarily saves changes without adding to the commit history.	Saves changes permanently as part of the repository’s history.
Visibility	Changes are private and not visible to others.	Changes are part of the project’s history and visible to others after a push.
Use Case	For unfinished work or quick temporary saves.	For completed and reviewed changes ready for the repository.
Reusability	Stashes can be reapplied multiple times if not dropped.	Commits are permanent and cannot be reapplied in the same way.
Naming	Stashes are anonymous or optionally named.	Commits must have a message describing the changes.
How to Use Stashing
Save Changes to Stash:
git stash
Stashes all tracked changes in your working directory.
Optionally, you can give the stash a name:

git stash push -m "Work in progress on feature X"
List Stashes:
git stash list
Shows all saved stashes.
Apply a Stash:
git stash apply
Applies the latest stash to your working directory but keeps the stash.
To apply a specific stash:

git stash apply stash@{n}
Drop a Stash:
git stash drop
Deletes the latest stash (or a specific stash).
Pop a Stash:
git stash pop
Applies the latest stash and removes it from the stash list.
Clear All Stashes:
git stash clear
Removes all stashes.
Example Workflow
You’re working on branch feature-x with uncommitted changes.
You’re asked to fix an urgent issue on main.
Save your work:
git stash
Switch to main:
git switch main
After fixing the issue, switch back to feature-x:
git switch feature-x
Reapply your changes:
git stash pop
When to Use Stashing Over Committing?
Use stashing:
When your changes are incomplete or experimental.
When you don’t want to clutter the commit history with temporary work.
Use committing:
When your changes are complete and ready to be shared with others.
Stashing is a temporary solution, while committing is permanent and tracked. It’s a powerful tool to keep your workflow clean and efficient.

Resetting and Reverting in Git
Resetting and reverting are ways to undo changes in your repository, but they work differently and are used for different purposes.

What is Reset?
The git reset command moves the HEAD pointer (and optionally your working directory) to a previous commit, effectively undoing changes in your project history.

Usage:
Modify your commit history and remove or unstage commits.
Adjust changes in the working directory or staging area.
Types of Git Reset

Soft Reset:
git reset --soft <commit>
Moves the HEAD pointer to the specified commit.
Keeps changes in the staging area (index) and working directory.
Use case: To modify commits without losing changes.
Mixed Reset (Default):
git reset <commit>
Moves the HEAD pointer and unstages changes from the commit.
Keeps changes in the working directory.
Use case: To re-stage changes for a new commit.
Hard Reset:
git reset --hard <commit>
Moves the HEAD pointer, removes changes from the staging area, and deletes changes in the working directory.
Use case: To completely discard changes and restore a previous state.
What is Revert?
The git revert command creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced in a specific commit while preserving the project history.

Usage:
Safely undo changes without rewriting the commit history.
Useful for public branches or collaborative workflows.
How to Revert a Commit

To revert a specific commit:
git revert <commit>
Creates a new commit that reverses the changes from <commit>.
To revert multiple commits:
git revert <commit1> <commit2>
If there are conflicts during the revert, resolve them and finish the process with:
git revert --continue
Key Differences Between Reset and Revert
Feature	Reset	Revert
Effect on History	Alters history by removing commits (potentially destructive).	Keeps history intact by adding a new commit.
Use Case	For local/private changes where rewriting history is safe.	For shared/public branches to avoid breaking others' work.
Impact	Can modify the staging area and working directory.	Only affects the repository by adding a new commit.
Risk	High risk (especially --hard), as it can delete changes.	Low risk, since changes are preserved in a new commit.
Workflow	Ideal for correcting local work before pushing changes.	Ideal for undoing committed changes on a shared branch.
When to Use Each
Use reset:
When working on a local branch and you want to adjust your commit history before sharing.
When you want to discard changes entirely (e.g., using --hard).
Use revert:
When working on a shared branch where rewriting history is not allowed or safe.
When you need to undo changes while preserving commit history.
Examples
Reset to Remove the Last Commit Locally:
git reset --soft HEAD~1
Removes the last commit but keeps changes staged.
Reset to Completely Undo the Last Commit:
git reset --hard HEAD~1
Discards the last commit and any associated changes.
Revert the Last Commit:
git revert HEAD
Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from the last commit.
Revert a Specific Commit:
git revert <commit-hash>
Reverses the changes from a specific commit while leaving history intact.
Best Practices
Use reset for local-only changes when you’re still preparing your branch for sharing.
Use revert for shared branches to safely undo changes without altering history.
Always double-check before using --hard to avoid losing uncommitted changes.
